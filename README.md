This is the server files for a very simple budgeting app that I developed. It is designed for highly local distribution with an associated Kotlin app and uses an API to allow updating of budget items. The budget app itself then interprets these and updates the server as required.

This is currently in a 'development' state, so one would need to change the secret key and server settings in order to use it as one's own api.
